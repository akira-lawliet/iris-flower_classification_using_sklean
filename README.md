# iris-flower_classification_using_scikit learn
This is a simple model build using sklean. This model uses the iris dataset to predict the type of iris flower based on some features.
This is a simple beginner project to indroduce and familiaize with the idea of machine learning to create prediction models in python.

Libraries used:
- scikit-learn : machine learning library used also used for the generation of data
- pandas: for data analysis and manipulation
- numpy: working with large multi-dimensional array
- seaborn and matplotlib: data-visualization

Model Used:
- the training, fitting and testing of the dataset was done on the linear-regression model.
-  *Linear Regression* is a statictical method used to predict a dependent variable based on the value of one or more independent varibles.
  It is expressed in the following expression:
                                              $$y = mx + c$$
