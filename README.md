# Iris Flower Classification Using Scikit Learn

This is a simple model built using sklearn. This model uses the iris dataset to predict the type of iris flower based on some features. This is a simple beginner project to introduce and familiarize with the idea of machine learning to create prediction models in Python.

## Libraries Used

- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used also for the generation of data
- **pandas**: For data analysis and manipulation
- **numpy**: Working with large multi-dimensional array
- **seaborn and matplotlib**: Data-visualization

## Model Used

The training, fitting, and testing of the dataset was done on the linear-regression model.

**Linear Regression** is a statistical method used to predict a dependent variable based on the value of one or more independent variables. It is expressed in the following expression:

$$y = mx + c$$

where:  
- $y$ = dependent variable  
- $x$ = independent variable  
- $m$ = slope of line (effect of $x$ on $y$)  
- $c$ = y-intercept  

This equation is used to predict the future value of $y$ given the new data $x$.
